## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Tailwind - CSS framework
- Vanilla JavaScript
- Vite.js for module bundling
- API for advice generation: [Advice Slip JSON API](https://api.adviceslip.com/)

### What I learned

- Handling async API requests using fetch() in JavaScript.
- Implementing neon light effects with CSS box-shadow for a glowing effect on hover.
- Controlling DOM elements dynamically based on screen size, such as switching the divider image based on the viewport.

### Continued development

- Improve the user interface with additional animations and transitions.
- Add features such as saving favorite advice or sharing it on social media.

### Useful resources

- [Tailwind official documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs) - This helped me with styling and responsive design.
